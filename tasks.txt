--------------Data------------------

MIMIC-III 

-------------Scope-------------------

Developing an NLP-based predictive model that analyzes clinical notes and patient data to predict the risk of hospital readmissions.

-----------Sub-goals-----------------

1) Data Prepration: patients' records and clinical notes. 
    1-1: need the data like: patient, admission histories: ---Done----
    1-2: Remove data with readmissions like newborns.
    1-3: Remove readmissions more than 30 days.
    1-4: Can I detect who generated these notes?
    1-5: subsampling to overcome imbalanced data
    Divide the notes into smaller chunks corresponding to single admissions.
    Each chunk is treated as a unit for prediction.
    1-6: notes: all the notes from addmission (concatenated) to 24 hours before the discharge time
        dataset 1: admission_notes to 24 hours before discharge time
        dataset 2: Discharge_time -72 hours < notes < Discharge_time - 24 hours
2) Prerproces text data : removing PHI, normalize text, tokenize, etc. 
    2-1: clinical XLNET:https://huggingface.co/papers/1912.11975

3) Create label for readmission risk based on hospital stay intervals.
    if subjectid.count>2: check the discharge and admission times. if delta_t<30 days: readmission = True
    all the notes of a patients including admission, ct, etc, are combined together and then divided into chuncks based on the smax ize of 
    a sequence model.

    Resume from here. Read the rest of paper
4) Extrct features from clinical notes using biobert.

5) Include structre data like patient demographic diagnoisis and lab results.

6) Fine-tune a language model using clinical notes to generate text embeddings?
    6-1: use RNNS as benchmark

7) Build the prediction model

8) Evaluation AUC-ROC

9) Deplpoy
