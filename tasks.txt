--------------Data------------------

MIMIC-III 

-------------Scope-------------------

Developing an NLP-based predictive model that analyzes clinical notes and patient data to predict the risk of hospital readmissions.

-----------Subgoals-----------------

1) Data Prepration: patients' records and clinical notes. 
    1-1: need the data like: patient, admission histories.


2) Prerproces text data : removing PHI, normalize text, tokenize, etc.

3) Create label for readmission risk based on hospital stay intervals.

4) Extrct features from clinical notes using biobert.

5) Include structre data like patient demographic diagnoisis and lab results.

6) Fine-tune a language model using clinical notes to generate text embeddings?

7) Build the prediction model

8) Evaluation AUC-ROC

9) Deplpoy
