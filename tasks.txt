--------------Data------------------

MIMIC-III 

-------------Scope-------------------

Developing an NLP-based predictive model that analyzes clinical notes and patient data to predict the risk of hospital readmissions.

-----------Sub-goals-----------------

1) Data Prepration: patients' records and clinical notes. 
    1-1: need the data like: patient, admission histories: ---Done----
    1-2: Remove data with readmissions like newborns.
    1-3: Remove readmissions more than 30 days.
    1-4: Can I detect who generated these notes?
    
2) Prerproces text data : removing PHI, normalize text, tokenize, etc. 
    2-1: clinical XLNET:https://huggingface.co/papers/1912.11975

3) Create label for readmission risk based on hospital stay intervals.
    if subjectid.count>2: check the discharge and admission times. if delta_t<30 days: readmission = True
    all the notes of a patients including admission, ct, etc, are combined together and then divided into chuncks based on the smax ize of 
    a sequence model.

4) Extrct features from clinical notes using biobert.

5) Include structre data like patient demographic diagnoisis and lab results.

6) Fine-tune a language model using clinical notes to generate text embeddings?
    6-1: use RNNS as benchmark

7) Build the prediction model

8) Evaluation AUC-ROC

9) Deplpoy
