--------------Data------------------

MIMIC-III 

-------------Scope-------------------

Developing an NLP-based predictive model that analyzes clinical notes and patient data to predict the risk of hospital readmissions.

-----------Sub-goals-----------------

1) Data Prepration: patients' records and clinical notes. 
    1-1: need the data like: patient, admission histories: ---Done----
    1-2: Remove data with readmissions like newborns.
    1-3: Remove readmissions more than 30 days.
    1-4: Can I detect who generated these notes?
    
2) Prerproces text data : removing PHI, normalize text, tokenize, etc.

3) Create label for readmission risk based on hospital stay intervals.

4) Extrct features from clinical notes using biobert.

5) Include structre data like patient demographic diagnoisis and lab results.

6) Fine-tune a language model using clinical notes to generate text embeddings?

7) Build the prediction model

8) Evaluation AUC-ROC

9) Deplpoy
