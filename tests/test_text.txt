History of Present Illness:
74 y/o female with history of schizophrenia, dementia, HTN, DM,
recent T12 fracture in [**Month (only) 205**] s/p vertebroplasty, recently
admitted in [**Month (only) 216**] for sepsis, source unknown: ? hardware vs.
PNA in last discharge summary. Initially thought to be
surgically related, CT of the back revealed no evidence for
infection (MRI contraindicated given hardware). There was ? of
LLL PNA as source although similarly imaging did not really
support this. The patient was treated with Vanc and Ceftaz and
D/C with the same. (known MRSA).
.
Patient now presents from NH with temp to 100.8, hypotension,
SBP in 80s, WBC 16, Hct 24 from baseline near 29 on [**2107-8-29**] with
+++ UA. Patient has known chronic GI bleeding for which workup
has previously been refused, and was only trace guaiac positive
here. Benign abdomen on exam. Likely with urosepsis, currently
fluid responsive.
.
Patient was with HR in 80s and then suddenly noted to be with HR
130 without clear precipitant, SBP improved to 120s. Review of
last D/C summ reveals patient was noted previously to have
intermittent bursts of what appeared to be sinus tach with rates
130s to 150s, although ? raised if this was atrial tach. Patient
D/C with lopressor 75mg PO bid. Given improved BP, given 50mg Po
x 1 this p.m.
.
Given persistent tachycardia & tachypnea, admitted to MICU


Past Medical History:
Dementia, schizophrenia, history of GI bleed for which she
declined work-up, gastroesophageal reflux disease, COPD,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, neuropathy,
urinary incontinence, recent T12 burst fracture complicated by
bilateral lower extremity
paresis, status post T12 vertebrectomy and T11-L1 fusion by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 363**]. Her OR course at that time was complicated by a lung
collapse requiring a chest tube placement, spinal, status post
PEG placement in [**2107-7-9**].

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-9-22**] 6:34 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: please eval

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old woman from NH arrives w/ hypotension, tachynpia.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval
74-year-old female nursing home resident, now with hypertension
and tachypnea.

COMPARISON: [**2107-8-24**].

AP PORTABLE CHEST: The heart size and cardiomediastinal contours
are within normal limits. The aorta is mildly tortuous and there
are calcifications of the arch. The left-sided PICC line has
been removed in the interval. The pulmonary vasculature is
unremarkable. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is identified. There remains linear scar or
atelectasis at the left base. The patient is status post
thoracolumbar spinal fixation with hardware in similar position.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74 y/o F w/ h/o schizophrenia, dementia, HTN, DM, recent
T12 fracture in [**Month (only) 205**] s/p vertebroplasty, recently admitted for
sepsis, now presents with hypotension, leukocytosis, and
positive urinalysis, with presumed urosepsis
.
# Hypotension: Suspected secondary to infection with urosepsis.
+U/A, with cultures pending.  Started empirically on
Vanco/Cefepime, fluid resuscitated, to which she immediately
responded with stable BPs.  For presumed UTI, she was
transitioned to PO levaquin and per PCP recs, started flagyl for
C. Diff ppx.
.
# Tachycardia: Initially felt secondary to volume depletion.
However continues to have persistent tachycardia despite volume
resucitation. ?rebound tachycardia off b-blocker, vs MAT. Resume
outpatient lopressor dose. Monitor HR/BP.
.
# DMII: Covered with humalog sliding scale.
# Schizophremia: cont outpatient regimen
# GI Bleed: h/o GI bleed, refuses evaluation. Hct 23 on
admission. Typed and crossed, transfused w/pRBC. Now that HD
stable, will transfuse for restrictive transfusion strategy, Hct
<21
# PPx: pneumoboots, PPI
# Access: PIV x 2
# Code: Full
